    """
    Compute spherical harmonics coefficients that describe an object stored as
    an image.

    Calculates the spherical harmonics coefficients that parametrize the shape
    formed by the foreground set of voxels in the input image. The input image
    does not need to be binary and all foreground voxels (background=0) are used
    in the computation. Foreground voxels must form a single connected component.
    If you are sure that this is the case for the input image, you can set
    compute_lcc to False to speed up the calculation. In addition, the shape is
    expected to be centered in the input image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Input image. Expected to have shape ZYX.
    lmax : int
        Order of the spherical harmonics parametrization. The higher the order
        the more shape details are represented.

    Returns
    -------
    coeffs_dict : dict
        Dictionary with the spherical harmonics coefficients and the mean square
        error between input and its parametrization
    grid_rec : ndarray
        Parametric grid representing sh parametrization
    image\\_ : ndarray
        Input image after pre-processing (lcc calculation, smooth and binarization).
    mesh : vtkPolyData
        Polydata representation of image\\_.
    grid_down : ndarray
        Parametric grid representing input object.
    transform : tuple of floats
        (xc, yc, zc, angle) if alignment_2d is True or
        (xc, yc, zc) if alignment_2d is False. (xc, yc, zc) are the coordinates
        of the shape centroid after alignment; angle is the angle used to align
        the image

    Other parameters
    ----------------
    sigma : float, optional
        The degree of smooth to be applied to the input image, default is 0 (no
        smooth)
    compute_lcc : bool, optional
        Whether to compute the largest connected component before applying the
        spherical harmonic parametrization, default is True. Set compute_lcc to
        False in case you are sure the input image contains a single connected
        component. It is crucial that parametrization is calculated on a single
        connected component object.
    alignment_2d : bool
        Whether the image should be aligned in 2d. Default is True.
    make_unique : bool
        Set true to make sure the alignment rotation is unique.

    Notes
    -----
    Alignment mode '2d' allows for keeping the z axis unchanged which might be
    important for some applications.

    """Compute spherical harmonics coefficients that describe an object

    This is the high-level entry point for users who already have a mesh
    (e.g. from a meshing pipeline, CAD or simulation) and want to avoid
    voxelizing it back into an image. It reuses the same fitting core as
    the image-based ``get_shcoeffs``.

    The surface is represented as a single radius per direction
    r(lon, lat), so it is expected to be closed and star-shaped about its
    centroid. ``check_mesh_for_parametrization`` is called to warn (not
    raise) when these assumptions appear to be violated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : vtkPolyData
        Input surface mesh.
    lmax : int
        Order of the spherical harmonics parametrization. The higher the
        order the more shape details are represented.
    alignment_2d : bool
        Whether the mesh should be aligned in 2d before parametrization.
        The alignment is computed on the mesh vertex point cloud (PCA of
        the xy coordinates) and applied as a rotation in the xy plane,
        leaving z unchanged. Default is True.
    make_unique : bool
        Set true to make sure the alignment rotation is unique.

    Returns
    -------
    coeffs_dict : dict
        Dictionary with the spherical harmonics coefficients.
    grid_rec : ndarray
        Parametric grid representing the SH parametrization.
    image\\_ : None
        Always None for mesh input; the slot is kept so the return shape
        matches ``get_shcoeffs`` and callers can unpack both identically.
    mesh : vtkPolyData
        The centered (and optionally aligned) mesh with updated normals.
    grid_down : ndarray
        Parametric grid representing the input object.
    transform : tuple of floats
        (xc, yc, zc, angle) if alignment_2d is True or (xc, yc, zc)
